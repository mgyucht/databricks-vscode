Run `deco gh clone-repos` to initialize your development environment. This command:

1. fetches all Deco repos from https://github.com/orgs/databricks/teams/eng-dev-ecosystem/repositories
2. clones those repos to your chosen directory (by default, your home directory)
3. creates symlinks in this folder to those repos.
